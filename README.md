# Lyric-Based-ML-on-Taylor-Swift-Eras-Tour

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This project is a deep dive into the discography of Taylor Swift, aiming to predict and detect which Eras(a group of albums performed during her Eras Tour) a lyrics is from. By utilizing natural language processing (NLP) techniques with machine learning models, this project not only demonstrates my passion for data science and machine learning but also showcases my ability to apply these skills to real-world datasets to uncover any hidden patterns and insights.

Skills Demonstrated:

### Data Preprocessing & Exploration:
Text Cleaning and Preprocessing: Implemented advanced text preprocessing techniques, including stopword removal and tokenization, to prepare the lyrics data for analysis. 
Word Cloud Visualization: Generated word clouds to visualize the most frequent words in Taylor Swift's songs, providing a quick glance at prevalent themes across her different Eras.

### Predictive Modeling: 
Experienced in applying various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest.

### Statistical Analysis: 
Conducted thorough model evaluations using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores to assess and compare model performances.

### Data Visualization: 
Used confusion matrices for some models to analyze true positives, false negatives, and false positives, enabling a detailed assessment of model predictions versus actual Eras a lyrics belong to.

### Feature Engineering: 
Transformed text data into a numerical format using TF-IDF, laying the groundwork for effective model training.
Enhanced feature engineering by incorporating n-grams into TF-IDF vectorization, capturing local context and improving model accuracy.
